# Analysis of PyBer Data

## Overview. Purpose of this new analysis is to how the data differs across various city types.

### Results. Based on the results in the summary data frame we can see that most of the activity is in densely populated areas. Urban accounts for the most rides, drivers and total fares. Conversely the average is the lowest of the three city types. This makes sense due to the higher density of urban areas. Trips tend to be shorter. 
Activity is lowest in rural areas. Demand in rural areas is the lowest of the city types. Rides, total drivers and total fares are the lowest city totals. As you would expect the average fare is the highest of the three due to the greater distances that need to be traveled in rural areas.

### Summary. Based on this analysis the three recommendations I would make would be:
1. Activity in urban areas is consistently the best category of business. Further focus on this sector makes sense.
2. Rural areas could be a source of growth. The average fares are higher and the number of drivers has room to grow. 
3. Based on the line chart, urban and suburban usage appears the trend up in the winter months. Having more drivers available in those months may lead to revenue growth possibly combined with focused advertising.
